# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to identify the amount of workforce retirements in Hewlett-Packard and to look for ways to future-proof the company in preparations of a silver tsunami's impact on the company.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

 - There is a large amount of retirees from within the company, upmost 90,000+ employees are at an retireable age just for the 3 selected years alone.
 - The titles that are highest in retirees seems to belong to Senior Engineers and Senior Staffs with both being over 28,000 retirements. On the flip side, Manager title has the least retirement, at 2.

 - The amount of people eligible to be in the mentorship program are way less than compared to the retiring forces from years 1952 through 1955. The 4 years have a combined total of 46 times the amount of this mentorship program.
 - There arn't as many Senior level staff in the mentorship program, compared to the retiring forces from 1952-1955.
 
## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

 - How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

  Just the initially selected retirement years alone will already make an impact at 90,000 opening. By looking at the numbers year to year on the employee list, it seems that there is about an event amount of employees retiring per year at around 20,000+ each retirement year. With that said, it would probably take 2-3 years of hiring at double the rate of retirements in order to cover the job openings.
  
 
 - Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

  Seeing that the employee counts at year 1965 appears to be 1940, this is drastically lower than any of the previous years at Hewlett-Packard. There appears to either be an issue with the data because the discrepancy seemingly odd on this year, or the company didn't do so well and had to slow down on hiring at this year. Either ways, there will not be enough employees to properly take on the mentorship program unless this program is opened to a few years above that too, such as for the 1964s and 1963s.
